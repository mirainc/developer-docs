Get started using [Toast](https://pos.toasttab.com/) with the On-Brand Menu API

## Create a Toast Source

First we need to setup a Toast source for the On-Brand Menu API. Sign in to the Developer Portal and navigate to the [API Keys](https://developers.raydiant.com/api-keys) section:

1. Click the “Create New…” button <RaydiantIcon name="add" />.
2. Select “API Source” <RaydiantIcon name="api-sources" />.
3. Name your new API Source to “My Toast Source”.
4. From the “Source” dropdown, select “Toast”.
5. Copy the unique location ID for your Toast source to the clipboard.

   ie. `2c92cb2c-eb29-430a-b3d8-33e80dca4956`

6. [Log in to Toast POS](https://pos.toasttab.com/login) in another browser tab.
7. From the Home page, navigate to the [My Integrations](https://www.toasttab.com/restaurants/admin/integrations/my-integrations) page.
8. Click “Add Integrations”.
9. Search for “Raydiant” and click “Add New”.
10. Select the location(s) you’d like to connect to the On-Brand Menu API.
11. Click the settings icon <RaydiantIcon name="toast-settings" /> next to the Raydiant integration from the [My Integrations](https://www.toasttab.com/restaurants/admin/integrations/my-integrations) page.
12. Paste the location ID from step 5 into the Location ID field and click “Apply”

    />

13. Navigate back to the Developer Portal and click “Done”.
14. Wait 10-15 seconds, if setup correctly you will see your new source successfully connect to your Toast location.

To connect multiple locations to the On-Brand Menu API repeat steps 1-13 for each location.

## Menu Groups and Items

Toast menu groups and items nested up to 4-levels deep will be returned from the On-Brand Menu API.

## Modifiers

Toast sized-based modifiers will be returned as sub-items from the On-Brand Menu API.

<Callout>The On-Brand Menu API does not support groups of sub-items. Toast modifier groups will be flattened into a single list of sub-items.</Callout>

## Tags

Tags on Toast items and groups will be returned from the On-Brand Menu API.

You can use tags on groups to [query for specific groups](/docs/on-brand-menus/reference/get-groups) from the On-Brand Menu API.

<Callout> Toast's `multiLocationId` is returned as a tag for _groups_, _items_ and _modifiers_.</Callout>

## Sales Category

A Toast item’s sales category will be returned from the On-Brand Menu API.

## Visibility

All items and groups in a Toast menu will be returned from On-Brand Menu API.

We recommend building a specific Toast menu for your digital menus to limit the amount of groups and items that show up on your screens.

## Sorting Items and Groups

The sort order of items and groups returned by the On-Brand Menu API is controlled via the order of the items and group set in Toast POS.

## Inventory

Set an items inventory status to “Out of Stock” or it’s “Quantity” to `0` to mark the item as out of stock.

## Publishing Updates

Menu updates are applied whenever you publish a location and stock updates are applied when you hit “Save” in Toast POS.

We’ve integrated with Toast’s webhooks so that menu and stock updates are available from the On-Brand Menu API in under a minute.
