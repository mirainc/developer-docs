excerpt: How to use NCR Aloha POS with the On-Brand Menu API.
---

Get started using [NCR Aloha](https://www.ncr.com/restaurants/aloha-restaurant-pos-system) with the On-Brand Menu API.

## Create a NCR Aloha Source

NCR Aloha support is currently in private beta, contact [product@raydiant.com](mailto:product@raydiant.com) and we’ll be in touch.

## Sub Menus

NCR Aloha sub menus will be returned as menu groups via the On-Brand Menu API. 

## Items and Modifiers

Modifiers in NCR Aloha will be returned as sub-items from the On-Brand Menu API. Sub-items are items that do not belong to a category but are instead associated with another menu item.

<Callout>The On-Brand Menu API does not support groups of sub-items. NCR Aloha "Modifier Groups" attached to an item will be flattened into a single list of sub-items.</Callout>

## Pricing
Menu items can inherit their price from a variety of options; however, only one price can be set for an item in a particular setting. The On-Brand Menu API will return the appropriate pricing based on the menu item’s configuration.

## Calories

NCR Aloha does not have a dedicated calorie field: use the “Description” field to store calorie and other supplemental data about an item such as allergens or gluten-free.

## Sales Category

NCR Aloha does not support sales categories.

## Visibility

Only NCR Aloha products and modifiers and marked as "Available" will be returned from the On-Brand Menu API.

## Sorting Items and Groups

The sort order of categories returned in the On-Brand Menu API is controlled by the order that is set in the NCR Aloha Portal.

## Publishing Updates

<Callout>NCR Aloha does not support push notification for menu updates via webhook or other mechanisms at the moment.</Callout>

The On-Brand Menu API is periodically updated for NCR Aloha restaurant locations: at the moment it is updated every hour, on the hour.
