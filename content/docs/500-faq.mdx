## What screen resolutions should my app support?

Displai marketplace apps should support [1080p, 720p and 4K](/docs/marketplace/review-checklist#supported-resolutions) in both portrait and landscape orientations. 

We recommend using [orientation CSS media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/orientation) to ensure your app is responsive to either orientation.

For the best responsive results, consider making your app scale to any 16:9 or 9:16 aspect ratio. Viewport CSS units like `vw`, `vh`, `vmax`, `vmin` are highly encouraged for font sizes, margins, paddings. Read more on these units [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units). 

## How do I track my app’s users?

Displai does not currently provide any analytics for your app. In the meantime we recommend using your preferred web analytics service such as [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) or [Plausible](https://plausible.io/).

## What browser is used on the device?

Our devices currently run Chromium 120.0.6099.199.

## How do I get a device?

If you are building a Displai app and do not have access to a device, reach out to [product@displai.ai](mailto:product@displai.ai).
