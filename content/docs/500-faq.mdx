## What screen resolutions should my app support?

Raydiant marketplace apps should support [1080p, 720p, 4K]((docs/marketplace/review-checklist#supported-resolutions)) in both portrait and landscape orientations.
For the best responsive results, consider making your app scale to any 16:9 or 9:16 aspect ratio.
Viewport CSS units like: "vw", "vh", "vmax", "vmin" are highly encouraged for
font sizes, margins, paddings.
Read more on these units [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units).
Layout sizing works best with CSS viewport or percentage units.

## How do I track my app’s users?

Raydiant does not currently provide any analytics for your app. In the meantime we recommend using your preferred web analytics service such as [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) or [Plausible](https://plausible.io/).

## What browser is used on the device?

Our devices currently run Chromium 85.0.4183.84.

## How do I get a device?

If you are building a Raydiant app and do not have access to a device, reach out to [product@raydiant.com](mailto:product@raydiant.com).
