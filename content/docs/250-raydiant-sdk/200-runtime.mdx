title: Runtime API
excerpt: Hook into the app lifecycle.
---

The Raydiant SDK's runtime API allow you to hook into the [app lifecycle](/docs/core-concepts/app-lifecycle) to:

- Start animations and videos when your app becomes visible
- Loop a video if it's the only presentation in a playlist
- Move to the next presentation in the playlist when an error occurs
- Add support for [dynamic durations](/docs/core-concepts/duration-mode)

## Usage

```js
// If installed with NPM:
import { runtime } from '@raydiant/sdk';
// Or if installed using the global script:
const { runtime } = window.Raydiant;

// Subscribe to the runtime's 'play' event. This event will be
// sent when your app becomes visible after being loaded in the
// background and whenever it loops.  
const unsubscribe = runtime.subscribe('play', () => {
  // ...
});

// Send 'complete' event to move to the next presentation in the
// playlist. If your app is the only presentation in the playlist, 
// the 'play' event triggered again.
runtime.complete();

// Send 'complete' event with error. Pass an error to complete when.
// your app has encountered an error, instructing the runtime to
// move on to the next presentation in the playlist.
runtime.complete(new Error());
```
