excerpt: APIs to hook into the app lifecycle
---

The Raydiant SDK's runtime APIs allow you to hook into the [app lifecycle](/docs/core-concepts/app-lifecycle) to:

- Start animations and videos when your app becomes visible
- Loop a video if it's the only presentation in a playlist
- Move to the next presentation in the playlist when an error occurs
- Add support for [dynamic durations](/docs/core-concepts/duration-type)

## Usage

```js
// If installed with NPM:
import { runtime } from '@raydiant/sdk';
// Or if installed using the global script:
const { runtime } = window.Raydiant;

// Subscribe to the runtime's 'play' event. This event will be
// sent when your app becomes visible after being loaded in the
// background and whenever it loops.  
const unsubscribe = runtime.subscribe('play', () => {
  // ...
});

// Send 'complete' event.
runtime.complete();

// Send 'complete' event with error.
runtime.complete(new Error());
```
