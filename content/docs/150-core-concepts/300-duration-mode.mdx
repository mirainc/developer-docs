title: Duration Mode
excerpt: TODO
---

When your app is in a playlist, the amount of time it is visible before moving on to the next presentation in the playlist is called the duration.

Raydiant apps support two different duration modes; _fixed_ and _dynamic_. 

## Fixed Duration

The duration of a _fixed_ duration app can be known upfront. For example, in our [Simple Weather](/docs/get-started/sample-apps/simple-weather) sample app the duration is configurable when creating a presentation. 

Since the runtime is able to determine the duration of the app before loading it—the Simple Weather app's duration mode is _fixed_. 

Fixed duration apps will automatically move on to the next presentation in the playlist after the configured duration.

<Callout>When your app is the only presentation in the playlist, the runtime _will not_ automatically refresh your app. Make sure to periodically update any data your app fetches on load.</Callout>


## Dynamic Duration

The duration of a _dynamic_ duration app **cannot** be known upfront. A dynamic duration app might move to next presentation in the playlist when:

- A video has finished playing
- The live stream or meeting has ended
- After 10 news articles have been cycled through

Since the runtime is unable to determine the duration of a dynamic duration app, you must use the [Raydiant SDK](/docs/raydiant-sdk) to notify the runtime when your app has completed.

```js
video.addEventListener('ended', () => {
  runtime.complete();
});
```
