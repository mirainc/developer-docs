excerpt: What you need to know about the on-device cache.
---

While many buildings you walk into today have an internet connection, the reality is that many [brick and mortar businesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_and_mortar) do not have a reliable one.

Displai devices come with a built-in cache to make your apps resilient to network disruptions and reduce bandwidth consumption.

If the device is unable to connect to the internet, it will automatically serve cached content while the device is offline.

## On-Device Cache

All requests made from you app are automatically cached. If the device is unable to connect to the internet, it will automatically serve cached content while it is is offline.

To reduce bandwidth consumption, you can set the [`Cache-Control` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) to control how long the content is cached on the device.
