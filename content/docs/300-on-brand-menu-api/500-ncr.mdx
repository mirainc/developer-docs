---

Get started using [NCR - Aloha](https://www.ncr.com/restaurants/aloha-restaurant-pos-system) with the On-Brand Menu API.

## Create a NCR - Aloha Source

NCR - Aloha support is currently in private beta, contact [product@raydiant.com](mailto:product@raydiant.com) and we’ll be in touch.

## Sub Menus

NCR - Aloha sub menus will be returned as menu groups via the On-Brand Menu API. 

## Items and Modifiers

Modifiers in the NCR - Aloha admin portal will be returned as sub-items from the On-Brand Menu API. Sub-items are items that do not belong to a category but are instead associated with another menu item.

<Callout>The On-Brand Menu API does not support groups of sub-items. NCR - Aloha "Modifier Groups" attached to an item will be flattened into a single list of sub-items.</Callout>

## Pricing
Menu items can inherit their price from a variety of options; however, only one price can be set for an item in a particular setting. The On-Brand Menu API will return the appropriate pricing based on the menu item’s configuration.

## Calories

Calories are not supported in a specific field by NCR - Aloha.

## Sales Category

NCR - Aloha does not support sales categories.

## Visibility

Only NCR - Aloha products and modifiers and marked as "Available" will be returned from the On-Brand Menu API.

## Sorting Items and Groups

The sort order of categories returned in the On-Brand Menu API is controlled by the order that is set in the NCR - Aloha Portal.

## Publishing Updates

<Callout>NCR - Aloha does not support push notification for menu updates via webhook or other mechanisms at the moment.</Callout>

The On-Brand Menu API is periodically updated for NCR - Aloha restaurant locations.
