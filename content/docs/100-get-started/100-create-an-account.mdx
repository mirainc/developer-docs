The Displai Developer Platform is in private beta.  If you are interested in building an app, get in touch at [displai.ai/developers](https://www.displai.ai/developers/) or talk to your account administrator.

A developer account will give you access to both the Displai Dashboard and the Developer Portal.

## Displai Dashboard

The [Displai Dashboard](https://dash.displai.ai) is where you can create playlists of content and publish them to your devices.

When you build a Displai app it will be available in the Dashboard, allowing you to test your appâ€™s inputs, how it behaves in a playlist and publish it to a device.

## Developer Portal

The [Developer Portal](https://developers.displai.ai) is where you can create and manage your Displai apps and API keys for the [On-Brand Menu API](/docs/on-brand-menus).

You can also submit your app to the [Marketplace](/docs/marketplace) through the Developer Portal to share it with thousands of other Displai users.
