title: App Lifecycle
excerpt: Learn how Raydiant apps work when running in a playlist.

When users configure your app via it’s [inputs](/docs/inputs), we call that a _presentation._ Presentations are assigned durations, added to playlists and then published to devices.

To avoid showing loading state and [FOUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content), a Raydiant app will only become visible on screen after its [window’s `onload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onload) handler is called.

Depending on if there is one or many presentations in the playlist, your app’s lifecycle will look a bit different.

## Single Presentation

<div>
  <Zoom className="img-light">
    <img className="img-light" src="/single-presentation-lifecycle-light.excalidraw.png" style={{ maxWidth: 400 }} />
  </Zoom>
  <Zoom overlayBgColorStart="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.95)">
    <img className="img-dark" src="/single-presentation-lifecycle-dark.excalidraw.png" style={{ maxWidth: 400 }} />
  </Zoom>
</div>


When there is only a single presentation in a playlist, your app will be loaded in the background when the device starts.

When the device detects that the app has finished loading it will become visible on the screen.

## Multiple Presentations

<div>
  <Zoom>
    <img className="img-light" src="/multiple-presentations-lifecycle-light.excalidraw.png" />
  </Zoom>
  <Zoom overlayBgColorStart="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.95)">
    <img className="img-dark" src="/multiple-presentations-lifecycle-dark.excalidraw.png" />
  </Zoom>
</div>

When there are multiple presentations in a playlist, your app will be immediately loaded in the background when it’s the _next_ presentation in the playlist.

When the _current_ presentation is complete and your app has finished loading it will become visible on the screen.

<Callout>**Upcoming feature:** Hook into the playlist lifecycle to know when your app is running in the background and when it becomes visible.</Callout>
